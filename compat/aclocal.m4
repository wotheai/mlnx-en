# For projects using AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR([foo]), Autoconf sets
# $ac_aux_dir to '$srcdir/foo'.  In other projects, it is set to
# '$srcdir', '$srcdir/..', or '$srcdir/../..'.
#
# Of course, Automake must honor this variable whenever it calls a
# tool from the auxiliary directory.  The problem is that $srcdir (and
# therefore $ac_aux_dir as well) can be either absolute or relative,
# depending on how configure is run.  This is pretty annoying, since
# it makes $ac_aux_dir quite unusable in subdirectories: in the top
# source directory, any form will work fine, but in subdirectories a
# relative path needs to be adjusted first.
#
# $ac_aux_dir/missing
#    fails when called from a subdirectory if $ac_aux_dir is relative
# $top_srcdir/$ac_aux_dir/missing
#    fails if $ac_aux_dir is absolute,
#    fails when called from a subdirectory in a VPATH build with
#          a relative $ac_aux_dir
#
# The reason of the latter failure is that $top_srcdir and $ac_aux_dir
# are both prefixed by $srcdir.  In an in-source build this is usually
# harmless because $srcdir is '.', but things will broke when you
# start a VPATH build or use an absolute $srcdir.
#
# So we could use something similar to $top_srcdir/$ac_aux_dir/missing,
# iff we strip the leading $srcdir from $ac_aux_dir.  That would be:
#   am_aux_dir='\$(top_srcdir)/'`expr "$ac_aux_dir" : "$srcdir//*\(.*\)"`
# and then we would define $MISSING as
#   MISSING="\${SHELL} $am_aux_dir/missing"
# This will work as long as MISSING is not called from configure, because
# unfortunately $(top_srcdir) has no meaning in configure.
# However there are other variables, like CC, which are often used in
# configure, and could therefore not use this "fixed" $ac_aux_dir.
#
# Another solution, used here, is to always expand $ac_aux_dir to an
# absolute PATH.  The drawback is that using absolute paths prevent a
# configured tree to be moved without reconfiguration.

Oops!

Your 'rm' program seems unable to run without file operands specified
on the command line, even when the '-f' option is present.  This is contrary
to the behaviour of most rm programs out there, and not conforming with
the upcoming POSIX standard: <http://austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=542>

Please tell bug-automake@gnu.org about your system, including the value
of your $PATH and any error possibly output before this message.  This
can help us improve future automake versions.

Aborting the configuration process, to ensure you take notice of the issue.

You can download and install GNU coreutils to get an 'rm' implementation
that behaves properly: <http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/>.

If you want to complete the configuration process using your problematic
'rm' anyway, export the environment variable ACCEPT_INFERIOR_RM_PROGRAM
to "yes", and re-run configure.
